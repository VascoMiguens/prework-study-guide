        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding property indicates hwo much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentialy a box</li>
          <li>* is a special wild card symbol that applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>Two or moore elemnents that share the same styling can be group together with a comma, allowing declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>"link" element creates the connection to an external file</li>
          <li>"rel" attribute specifies the relationship betwenn the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>"href" attribute specifies the location(URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>The "margin" property assigns a value to the top and bottom, left and right</li>
          <li>The "box-shadow" property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color</li>
        </ul>

          <li>git checkout -A: commits all files to the working branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values</li>
          <li>The let declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables)</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the "if...else" statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code</li>
          <li>An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.</li>
          <li>Event handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response</li>
          <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
          <li>The ".log()" method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li> The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
